# Publish Markdown reports

This is an **extension for Azure Pipelines** to publish Markdown files in a tab in a build result page.

I developed this extension to show **Markdown files**, which are automatically generated in a pipeline, such as a document generated by [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) and [Doxybook2](https://github.com/matusnovak/doxybook2).

## Overview

This extension adds a "Markdown reports" tab to a build result page as follows:

## Usage

### Project setting

Add this extension to your project in Marketplace page.

### Pipeline setting

Add the following YAML definition in your pipeline.

```yaml
- task: PublishMarkdownReports@1
  inputs:
    contentPath: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/markdown
    indexFile: main_page.md
```

`contentPath` specifies a root directory of your Markdown files.  
`indexFile` is optional. `index.md` is used as default.
